# UFO Sightings

## Project Overview

This project uses Javascript ES6+ to build a dynamic website that filters UFO sighting data from a Javascript data array file. The site allows the user to filter data based on the date, city, country, and UFO shape of the sighting, showing results based on just a single filter or multiple filters at the same time, allowing for fine-tuned results. 

## Resources

- Data Sources: data.js
- Software: Visual Studio Code 1.67, Javascript ES6+, Bootstrap 3.3.7
